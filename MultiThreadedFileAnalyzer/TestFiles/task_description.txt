=== SYSTEM PROGRAMMING: MULTITHREADING TASK ===

Project Goal: 
Create a high-performance file analyzer that uses multiple threads.
This approach allows us to utilize all CPU cores effectively.

Key concepts we are practicing:
1. Process: The container for our application.
2. Thread: The worker that performs the counting logic.
3. ConcurrentQueue: A thread-safe way to distribute files.
4. Interlocked: Atomic operations for global statistics.

The application must handle:
- Directory scanning (recursive)
- Thread management (starting and joining)
- Data aggregation (collecting all results)

Sample data for counting:
Line 1: Word
Line 2: Word Word
Line 3: Word Word Word

Current status: Waiting for the student to write the code.
Success is inevitable if you understand how threads work!
